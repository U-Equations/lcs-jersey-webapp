U-Equations' first push to GitHub: LCS Jersey RESTful Web App

U-Equations' first push to Github is the classic Longest Common Substring algorithm implemented in a Java-based web application with RESTful Web Services. The implementation is Jersey REST.  The exercise shows use of the javax.json.JsonObject, JsonArray, and JsonValue objects.  These objects are used to store & manipulate form data in JSON format.  The .serializeJson() JavaScript method(referenced below) played a central role in transforming the form data into JSON on the client side before being sent using an ajax request.
